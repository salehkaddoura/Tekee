					<p>My name is Saleh Kaddoura, I am a front-end web developer and an aspiring software engineer. I have 2 years of experience in front-end web development and I am looking forward to a continuous journey of learning new information and expanding my knowledge. HTML, CSS, Javascript (jQuery), and C++ are my specialties. I also like to fiddle in back-end when the need arises (I am currently learning Node.js and MongoDB), although at the moment my specialties are in building the user experience. "The Tekee" is both a showcase for my portfolio and my freelance business name.</p>
					<p>When I am not coding, developing the web, or learning new information I often find myself using the web or reading about it. I have been hooked to everything technologically related since the age of 10, when I setup my family's home network. In my free time, I also enjoy playing basketball and soccer, going on hikes, listening to music, watching movies, and of course spending time with friends and family as I value my social life greatly. I am what you would call a "people person". I am currently a student at De Anza college with hopes of transferring to UCB, UCSB, or UCSC to continue my education.</p>
					<span><p>Thanks for stopping by!</p></span>

						<p>Flagship Killer? Maybe not, but still an awesome phone. This device will definitely be my next purchase. It's awesome. I'm still trying to convince myself about the screen size though; 5.5" is pretty big. I have had the Samsung Galaxy S4 for the past year and it's definitely a cool phone: sleek, fast, and responsive, but I enjoy change. The phone I owned before the S4 was a Droid Charge, one of the first 4G LTE phones on the Verizon network. Prior to that, I owned the OG Motrola Droid probably one of my favorite phones. I didn't fall in love with it until after I rooted it and that's definitely when I fell in love with the Android OS. I love the freedom of customization. That was around the time when I also discovered CyanogenMod and now they have a phone! So why not? Watch the video and click <span><a href="http://oneplus.net/">Here</a></span> for more info.</p>

						<p>My current project is learning Node.js and applying it to all of my websites. I found out about Node a couple of months ago and I've begun to realize how awesome and versatile it is. Plus, I've always been interested in server-side architecture so I decided to join in on the hype. Here are some links that I've been reading to help me out: <span><a href="http://howtonode.org/express-mongodb">Link 1</a></span> <span><a href="http://javascriptissexy.com/learn-node-js-completely-and-with-confidence/">Link 2</a></span> <span><a href="http://nodeschool.io/">Link 3</a></span></p>

					<div class="post-container"><p><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/dashboard">Code Academy</a> is a great place to start learning programming if you have never coded before. If you are interested in web development i would recommend starting with their HTML and CSS tracks. Or if you are just interested in programming in general and want to get a feel of what coding is like start with the python track a very popular and powerful scripting language.</p></div>

					</div>
					<div class="post-container"><p>Chef's Special is a project I started working on with a classmate at my first hackathon <a href="http://www.codeday.org/">Code Day</a>. The original idea was to build a music blog from scratch but that was a little ambitious for 24hrs so we then decided on creating a robot that suggests song to a user based of their listening preferences and playlists, but also specifically to suggest aritsts that aren't mainstream or popular to help promote up and comin music. I had never used API's before and this project was a really good introduction in helping me understand how Javascript, API's, and HTML work together. The project is still being worked on and is part of a bigger project im working on <a href="http://cuttymc.herokuapp.com/">Cutty Music Collective</a>.</p></div>
